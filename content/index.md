The current timeline is 200 years after the great cataclysm, “The New Dawn”. 
A massive solar flare hit Earth, destroying satellites and other telecommunication, but that was just a small consequence. The solar flare was so powerful that, for a couple of seconds, Earth’s magnetic field and Ozone layer were overwhelmed, resulting in the world being blanketed with high-energy electromagnetic waves. 
It was estimated that more than half of the world’s population died in those few seconds. While the living underwent enormous changes. The majority of the remaining plants, animals, and humans all underwent genetic mutations. 
Some mutated into blobs and stopped functioning, some became crippled, and others became stronger and more ferocious. Animals and plants that have successfully mutated powers are generally more aggressive and violent. 
Insects and bugs are more resistant to radiation, so there are fewer mutated species. Sea creatures rule the ocean, and sea travel is almost impossible. Aerial creatures rule the sky, and sky travel is extremely difficult because of herds. 
Humans gained power. These mutations helped the human race survive in the new world. More than half of the human race died in the initial solar flare event, and the population was further reduced to a mere 10% after the first month. 
All around the major countries, individuals who gained tremendous powers from their mutations came forth and rallied the survivors in their area. 
The last bastion of human society consisted of a couple of fortified cities in the major countries in the world. These bastions are in contact with each other within their own countries, but do not know about the others in other countries. 
In the present day, the bastions provide basic welfare: food, water, shelter. Hunger is no longer a problem because the ration bar was created. They provide essential calories, protein, minerals, and vitamins for survival, but are lacking in taste. Food is a luxury.

Every family unit is given one apartment room in the towering buildings. Land is precious and is maximised in the lower-income areas.

There are only two bastions in the state formerly known as Texas: Hammerfell and Emerald. Every other form of human civilization has been overrun by the wildlife. The two bastions were known as Austin and Dallas, respectively. They are ~200 miles apart. The two bastions are named after the two heroes who led the survivors to combat the new world. Our story begins in Hammerfell. The population is ⅔ of the original, ~600,000.
