We are all end up on the same team
We all discuss our powers, and introduce ourselves to each other. 

We travel south.
We happen upon ruins, a body of water. 
[[Paxton]] realizes the water should not be here.

Our group encounter a large [[bobcat]] and four of its [[bobcat]] wives.
-> [[BHA combat log 1]]

Many in the group realize they should get out of the open now. 

The group heads into a nearby building to rest

While we rest->
*small encounter*
```
*Two snakes attack* -> [[Roque]] and [[Chuck]]

Chuck gets hit by a snake and is dazed

[[Roque]] gets hit

[[Paxton]] meditates
[[Chuck]] stretches, and listens to some audio ASMR

[[Tag]] does some spray paint. 

Less gunfire over the next hour

Competitors are further away.

Roque noticed 3 beasts, and perhaps a human in trouble, lets the rest of the group know. 

[[Paxton]] and [[Tag]] rush to the scene, a crashed plane is in the scene, with two buildings, and a large crater

Ape and 2 monkeys are surrounding people. 
[[Lucas Warwick]] is surrounded, one of the 4 prince/ princesses of the bastion, wearing his goggles and battlesuit. 

Perhaps a Boeing is crashed.

[[Chuck]] chucks a fucking rock a the ape, and it fucking dies. 

[[Lucas Warwick]] is intrigued to see a fellow speedster, and acknowledges the rock throw as well as [[Tag]]. 

[[Lucas Warwick]] tells [[Tag]] they are quite amazing, and asks where they have been. 

- Tag - The streets
- Lucas - Which bar is that
- Lucas - you should join my group, 
	- *hands [[Tag]] a gold business card*
- Tag - *takes the card, begins to crash*
- Lucas - *hands an energizing bar to [[Tag]]* Here, take this.
- Tag - *Takes bar* Thanks

Team clears points threshold

- Lucas - thanks for the help, didn't need it but thank you
- Paxton - No worries, I just wanted to help
- Lucas - *gives a mentoring pat*
- Paxton - thank you!

Lucas explains to [[Chuck]] he is there to have a little fun. He is surprised everyone came so quickly. 

Lucas says he is positive he will pass either way.
